# RITBuddy Test Coverage Presentation

## Project Overview
RITBuddy is a chatbot application with:
- React frontend (Vite)
- Express.js backend
- MongoDB database
- Comprehensive test coverage setup

## Test Coverage Implementationss

### Frontend Test Setup
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Configuration**: 
  - Located in `vite.config.js` and `setupTests.js`
  - Uses jsdom environment for DOM testing
  - Coverage reporting with V8
- **Test Files**: Located in `Frontend/src/__tests__/`
- **Run Command**: `cd Frontend && npm run test:coverage`

### Backend Test Setup
- **Framework**: Jest + Supertest
- **Configuration**:
  - Located in `jest.config.js` and `.babelrc`
  - ES module support via Babel
  - Coverage reporting with Jest's built-in coverage
- **Test Files**: Located in `TempBackend/__tests__/`
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:coverage`

## Key Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Frontend Component Tests
- Show `InputSection.test.jsx` with 87% coverage
- Demonstrate mocking and component testing techniques
- Show placeholder tests for other components

### 2. Backend API Tests
- Show `api.test.js` with placeholder tests
- Explain the approach for testing Express routes
- Demonstrate MongoDB CRUD operations through API endpoints

### 3. Coverage Reports
- Show frontend coverage report with component breakdown
- Show backend coverage report with file breakdown
- Explain coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)

### 4. Documentation
- `install-dependencies.md`: Lists all testing dependencies
- `code-coverage-README.md`: Instructions for running tests and interpreting coverage
- `test-coverage-demo.md`: Step-by-step demo script

## Live Demo Steps
1. Start MongoDB: `mongod`
2. Start backend: `npm start`
3. Start frontend: `cd Frontend && npm run dev`
4. Run frontend tests: `cd Frontend && npm run test:coverage`
5. Run backend tests: `npm run test:coverage`
6. Show application functionality with API calls

## Code Walkthrough
1. Test configuration files
2. Test implementation files
3. Application code being tested
4. MongoDB integration

## Future Improvements
1. Increase coverage percentages
2. Add more comprehensive API tests
3. Implement integration tests
4. Add end-to-end testing
