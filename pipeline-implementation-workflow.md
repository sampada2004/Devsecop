## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup GitHub Actions Workflow Files

1. **Create CI Workflow File**

   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: RITBuddy CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main, develop ]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: '18'
           cache: 'npm'
       
       - name: Install Backend Dependencies
         working-directory: ./TempBackend
         run: npm ci
       
       - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
         working-directory: ./Frontend
         run: npm ci
       
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
         with:
           python-version: '3.10'
           cache: 'pip'
       
       - name: Install Python Dependencies
         run: pip install -r requirements.txt
       
       - name: Run Backend Tests
         working-directory: ./TempBackend
         run: npm test
       
       - name: Run Frontend Tests
         working-directory: ./Frontend
         run: npm test
       
       - name: Upload Coverage Reports
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: coverage-reports
           path: |
             ./TempBackend/coverage
             ./Frontend/coverage
   ```

2. **Create CD Workflow File**

   Create `.github/workflows/cd.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: RITBuddy CD

   on:
     workflow_run:
       workflows: ["RITBuddy CI"]
       branches: [main]
       types:
         - completed

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
       
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       
       - name: Set up Docker Buildx
         uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
       
       - name: Login to Docker Hub
         uses: docker/login-action@v2
         with:
           username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
           password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
       
       - name: Build and Push Docker Image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
         with:
           context: .
           push: true
           tags: |
             yourusername/ritbuddy:latest
             yourusername/ritbuddy:${{ github.sha }}
       
       - name: Deploy to Production Server
         uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
         with:
           host: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_HOST }}
           username: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_USERNAME }}
           key: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY }}
           script: |
             cd /path/to/deployment
             docker pull yourusername/ritbuddy:latest
             docker-compose down
             docker-compose up -d
             
       - name: Verify Deployment
         run: |
           # Add verification steps here
           echo "Verifying deployment..."
           # Example: curl -s https://your-production-url.com/health | grep "ok"
   ```

### Phase 2: Configure Repository Secrets

1. **Add Required Secrets to GitHub Repository**

   Navigate to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret

   Add the following secrets:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token
   - `PRODUCTION_HOST`: Hostname or IP of your production server
   - `PRODUCTION_USERNAME`: SSH username for the production server
   - `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for accessing the production server

### Phase 3: Update Docker Configuration

1. **Verify Dockerfile**

   Ensure your `Dockerfile` is properly configured:

   ```dockerfile
   # Use an appropriate base image
   FROM node:18-alpine AS frontend-build
   
   # Build the frontend
   WORKDIR /app/frontend
   COPY Frontend/package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci
   COPY Frontend/ ./
   RUN npm run build
   
   # Build the backend
   FROM python:3.10-slim
   
   # Install Node.js for the backend
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm
   
   # Set up backend
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY TempBackend/ ./backend/
   WORKDIR /app/backend
   RUN npm ci
   
   # Set up Python environment
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   
   # Copy backend files
   COPY api.py rag.py ./
   COPY data/ ./data/
   
   # Copy built frontend from previous stage
   COPY --from=frontend-build /app/frontend/dist /app/frontend/dist
   
   # Expose ports
   EXPOSE 5000
   
   # Start the application
   CMD ["python", "api.py"]
   ```

2. **Create or Update docker-compose.yml**

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   
   services:
     ritbuddy:
       image: yourusername/ritbuddy:latest
       restart: always
       ports:

       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
       volumes:
         - ./data:/app/data
   
     prometheus:
       image: prom/prometheus
       volumes:
         - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
       ports:
         - "9090:9090"
       depends_on:
         - ritbuddy
   
     grafana:
       image: grafana/grafana
       volumes:
         - ./grafana/provisioning:/etc/grafana/provisioning
         - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:

   ```javascript
   // vite.config.js
   export default defineConfig({
     // ... other config
     test: {
       environment: 'jsdom',
       coverage: {
         provider: 'v8',
         reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
         thresholds: {
           statements: 70,
           branches: 70,
           functions: 70,
           lines: 70
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Update Backend Test Configuration**

   Verify `jest.config.js` includes coverage settings:

   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     // ... other config
     collectCoverage: true,
     coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
     coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'json'],
     coverageThreshold: {
       global: {
         statements: 70,
         branches: 70,
         functions: 70,
         lines: 70
       }
     }
   };
   ```

### Phase 5: Implement Quality Gates

1. **Add Linting to CI Workflow**

   Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include linting:

   ```yaml
   # Add these steps to the CI workflow
   - name: Lint Backend
     working-directory: ./TempBackend
     run: npm run lint
   
   - name: Lint Frontend
     working-directory: ./Frontend
     run: npm run lint
   ```

2. **Add ESLint Configuration**

   Create `.eslintrc.js` in both Frontend and TempBackend directories:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     env: {
       browser: true,
       es2021: true,
       node: true,
       jest: true
     },
     extends: [
       'eslint:recommended',
       // Add appropriate framework extensions
     ],
     parserOptions: {
       ecmaVersion: 'latest',
       sourceType: 'module'
     },
     rules: {
       // Add project-specific rules
     }
   };
   ```

### Phase 6: Implement Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Configure Prometheus for Metrics Collection**

   Verify `prometheus.yml` is properly configured:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s
   
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'ritbuddy'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['ritbuddy:5000']
   ```

2. **Set Up Grafana Dashboards**

   Create dashboard JSON files in `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`

3. **Configure Alerting Rules**

   Create alerting rules in Grafana or Prometheus for critical metrics

### Phase 7: Testing the Pipeline

1. **Make a Test Commit**

   Push a small change to trigger the CI pipeline:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: trigger CI pipeline"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor GitHub Actions**

   Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow execution

3. **Verify Deployment**

   Check that your application has been deployed correctly to the production server
